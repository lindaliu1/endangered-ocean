# Our Endangered Oceans

An interactive visualization displaying endangered ocean species data sourced from the NOAA species directory.

Data was scraped, normalized, and stored in a Postgres database using a Python backend API. The frontend (current WIP) is built with React and TypeScript, featuring a scrollable ocean-themed layout to explore endangered species placed at the depth ranges they inhabit. Filtering options on endangered status and threats allow users to customize which species are displayed.
